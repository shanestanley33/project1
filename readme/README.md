## 🃏 Chemistry Card Flipper

**[Card Flipper](https://shanestanley33.github.io/project1/) is an intuitive game for all ages. This is a take on the classic Concentration-style game.**

## ❓ How to play?
**You are provided with a set of cards with images on their faces. At the start of the game, the cards are turned face down. Click on a card and it will turn over to reveal the image. Find two cards with the same image to make a match. Once you have found all of the matches, you win the game!**

## Future plans: 
1. highlight and un-highlight cards that are in use
2. @media screen and (min-width) for different screen sizes
3. add a countdown timer and game-over if time runs out
4. add a pause/stop music button
